# VRChat OSC

A couple of programs that interface with VRChat's OSC system using "Small example OSC server" from https://github.com/attwad/python-osc.

Includes:
- Haptic Module: For Raspberry Pi. Listens to OSC messages on the network, taking in an INT from a specified avatar parameter and playing the corresponding effect on an attached DRV2605L Haptic Motor controller. See the code for more details.
- Contact Haptic: (Old) A haptic module server that takes input from a VRChat contact and forwards it to a specific device running an OSC client that can trigger a vibration.
- LateWarner: A script that gets the current time, and if it matches a "Late" condition on specific days, sends a message to the VRChat chatbox. It also sets a "toggle/latewarner" parameter on the avatar so the avatar can react to it being late, for example by changing to a sleepy expression or emitting Z particles.

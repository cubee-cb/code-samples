The first VR PICO-8 game: Beat Saber demake built from MBoffin's Simple FPS Controller cart. Originally intended to display in-headset and interface with WebXR via JavaScript, but I couldn't figure out how to draw the screen directly to the HMD. Perhaps for the best?
WebXR files can be found at the bottom of Bad Saber's homepage.

- badsaber-p8.p8 - Controlled with mouse. Can move the camera using ESDF.
- badsaber-vr.p8 - Interfaces with a WebXR script to position the camera at the HMD location. An attempt was made to include the hand controllers as well.
- badsaber-vr-2screen.p8 - As badsaber-vr. Uses PICO-8's "-displays_x 2" launch option to render two displays.

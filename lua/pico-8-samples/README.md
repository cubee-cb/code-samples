# PICO-8 Samples

Full source carts for a few PICO-8 games I've made.

- 3d-badsaber - Beat Saber demake and other 3D experiments. Also contains some low-poly Mii models for a Tomodachi Collection demake prototype.
- 2m0rrow - Tomorrow's Vege-Mallet Therapy. A fast-paced game where you have to find and whack a robot with a massive vegemite mallet.
- beatem - A beat-em-up game I was making, but ran into issues getting all the content to fit that I wanted. The game also went through an entire engine rewrite to be more efficient on tokens.
- terra - Terra - A Terraria Demake. Contains several revision versions and changelogs. The changelog contains what Terra versions each cart corresponds to.
